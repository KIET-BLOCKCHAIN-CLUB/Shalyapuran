           <h1>CARDIOLOGY:</h1>
           <br>
           <h2>Abnormal Heart Rhythms</h2>
           <p>
               The heart is an amazing organ. It beats in a steady, even rhythm, about 60 to 100 times each minute. That's about 100,000 times each day. Sometimes, your heart gets out of rhythm. An irregular or abnormal heartbeat is called an arrhythmia. An arrhythmia (also called a dysrhythmia) can produce an uneven heartbeat, or a very slow or very fast beat.
           </p>
           <h2>HEART FAILURE:</h2>
           <p> The term can be frightening. It doesn’t mean the heart has "failed," or stopped working. It means the heart doesn’t pump as well as it should. This will cause you to retain salt and water, which will give you swelling and shortness of breath.
        Heart failure is a major health problem in the U.S., affecting more than 6.5 million Americans. It is the leading cause of hospitalization in people older than age 65.
        <br>
        The number of people diagnosed with heart failure is projected to rise by 46 percent by 2030, according to the American Heart Association.<br>

        <h3>Coronary Artery Disease</h3>
        You may hear this called CAD. It’s hardening of the arteries that give the heart vital oxygen and nutrients. That hardening can also be referred to as atherosclerosis.<br><br>
        <h2>Types Of Diseases<hr></h2>
        

        <!--narrowing of the arteries)-->
        <li>Heart attack</li>
        <li>Abnormal heart rhythms, or arrhythmias</li>
        <li>Heart failure</li>
        <li>Heart valve disease</li>
        <li>Congenital heart disease</li>
        <li>Heart muscle disease (cardiomyopathy)</li>
        <li>Pericardial disease</li>
        <li>Aorta disease and Marfan syndrome</li>
        <li>Vascular disease (bloodvessel disease)</li>
        <h3>Treatments for Heart Attack and Unstable Angina</h3>
        <b>Heart Attack <br>
            Immediate treatment</b>
        Emergency assessment and treatment should be conducted quickly. Treatment will depend on when your symptoms started and how soon you can access treatment.
        If symptoms started within the last 12 hours, percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) will be offered.1,2
        If symptoms started within the past 12 hours but you cannot access PCI quickly, medication to break down the blood clots will be prescribed.
        If symptoms started more than 12 hours ago, and symptoms have improved, the best course of treatment will be determined by an angiogram. The following may be proposed: medication, PCI or bypass surgery.1,2<br>
        <b>Anticoagulant Medications 3‒5</b>
        Anticoagulants are types of drugs that manipulate the blood coagulation process (the so-called plasmatic coagulation). They inhibit thrombus formation, meaning that they prevent blood clots from forming too easily. Anticoagulants generally include non-VKA oral anticoagulants (NOACs), heparins and vitamin K antagonists. All of these have different ways of working. Due to the pharmacological mode of action, the use of anticoagulants may be associated with an increased risk of occult or overt bleeding from any tissue or organ which may results in post haemorrhagic anaemia. The signs, symptoms and severity will vary according to the location (e.g. blood in urine, severe bruising) and degree or extent of the bleeding and/ or anaemia. Your doctor will work out which anticoagulant is right for you based on the indication and the presence of any other medical conditions. All licensed anticoagulants deliver a positive benefit risk profile. Although all anticoagulants can increase the risk of bleeding, strategies are available to reduce or stop bleeding.<br>
        <b>Antiplatelet medicines5,6</b>
        Antiplatelet medicines (e.g. Aspirin7, Clopidogrel8, Ticagrelor9, Prasugrel10) are types of drugs that decrease platelet aggregation. They inhibit thrombus formation and are mainly effective in the arterial circulation . Your doctor will work out which antiplatelet is right for you based on the indication and the presence of any other medical conditions. All licensed antiplatelets deliver a positive benefit risk profile. Although all antiplatelets can increase the risk of bleeding, strategies are available to reduce or stop bleeding.<br>
        <b>Fibrinolytic Drugs6,11</b>
        Fibrinolytic drugs activate plasminogen (the inactive precursor to plasmin), to form plasmin (an enzyme in the blood) which breaks down fibrin. This, in turn, breaks up clots. Drugs in this class include streptokinase.<br>
        <h3>Post-occurrence treatment</h3>
        <b>Post-occurrence1,2</b><br>
        The following drug treatments are usually prescribed to a person who has recently had a heart attack:<br>
        Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) Inhibitors7,12
        ACE inhibitors are a class of medicines that cause blood vessels to relax, lowering blood pressure and increasing the supply of oxygen to the heart.
        Drugs in this class include ramipril and enalapril.<br>
        <b>Beta-blockers13</b><br>
        Are a class of drugs that may help to prevent attacks of angina and reduce your risk of having a further heart attack, by lowering high blood pressure, relieving chest pain, controlling irregular heart beat and protecting the heart in the early treatment post heart attack.<br>
        Drugs in this class include propranolol and atenolol.<br>
        <b>Statins9,14</b><br>
        Are a class of drugs that reduce blood cholesterol levels, by reducing the amount of cholesterol produced by the liver.
        Drugs in this class include Simvastatin.
        <b>Unstable Angina15</b>
        <br>
        As a result of having unstable angina you may be at a higher risk of having a heart attack, so tests can be conducted to look at the level of risk. If there is a high risk, an examination to assess the size and location of the blockage in the coronary artery can be carried out. If the blockage is large, surgery may be necessary in the form of a coronary artery bypass graft or a percutaneous coronary intervention.<br>
        <b>1.Glycerol Trinitrate (GTN)16</b><br>
        GTN, in contrast to clopidogrel and aspirin, is not used as a regular prophylactic medication but is instead used to treat episodes of high blood pressure and chest pain. GTN acts to widen blood vessel walls, which reduces blood pressure and alleviates chest pain. GTN is taken orally in the form of a sublingual spray or as a tablet dissolved under the tongue.<br>

        <b>How are Heart Attack and Unstable Angina Diagnosed?</b>
        <br>
        <li>Most people experiencing symptoms of heart attack and unstable angina, require admission or referral to hospital. A doctor can then conduct the following tests to confirm suspected heart attack and unstable angina.1‒5</li>
        <br>
        <li>A resting 12-lead electrocardiogram ECG</li>
        <li>Blood tests (e.g. serum troponin levels)</li>
        <br>
        The same tests can be conducted in the primary care (general practice) setting if the pain symptoms were experienced more than 72 hours earlier and there are no complications.<br>

        <h1>3.Coronary Artery Disease:</h1>

        <h3>Causes of coronary artery disease</h3>
        The most common cause of CAD is vascular injury with cholesterol plaque buildup in the arteries, known as atherosclerosis. Reduced blood flow occurs when one or more of these arteries becomes partially or completely blocked.
        The four primary coronary arteries are located on the surface of the heart:
        <li>right main coronary artery</li>
        <li>left main coronary artery</li>
        <li>left circumflex artery</li>
        <li>left anterior descending artery</li>
        These arteries bring oxygen and nutrient-rich blood to your heart. Your heart is a muscle that’s responsible for pumping blood throughout your body. According to the Cleveland Clinic, a healthy heart moves approximately 3,000 gallons of blood through your body every day.<br>
        Like any other organ or muscle, your heart must receive an adequate, dependable supply of blood in order to carry out its work. Reduced blood flow to your heart can cause symptoms of CAD.<br>
        Other rare causes of damage or blockage to a coronary artery also limit blood flow to the heart.<br>

        <h3>Symptoms of CAD</h3>
        When your heart doesn’t get enough arterial blood, you may experience a variety of symptoms. Angina (chest discomfort) is the most common symptom of CAD. Some people describe this discomfort as:
        <li>chest pain</li>
        <li>heaviness</li>
        <li>tightness</li>
        <li>burning</li>
        <li>squeezing</li>
        These symptoms can also be mistaken for heartburn or indigestion.
        Other symptoms of CAD include:<br>
        <li>pain in the arms or shoulders</li>
        <li>shortness of breath</li>
        <li>sweating</li>
        <li>dizziness</li>
        You may experience more symptoms when your blood flow is more restricted. If a blockage cuts off blood flow completely or almost completely, your heart muscle will start to die if not restored. This is a heart attack.<br>
        Don’t ignore any of these symptoms, especially if they are excruciating or last longer than five minutes. Immediate medical treatment is necessary.<br>
        <h3>Symptoms of CAD for women</h3><br>
        Women may also experience the above symptoms, but they’re also more likely to have:
        <li>nausea</li>
        <li>vomiting</li>
        <li>back pain</li>
        <li>jaw pain</li>
        <li>shortness of breath without feeling chest pain
            Men have a higher risk of developing heart disease <br>
            than premenopausal women. Postmenopausal women by age 70 have the same risk as men.<br>
            Due to decreased blood flow, your heart may also:
        <li>become weak</li>
        <li>develop abnormal heart rhythms (arrhythmia) or rates</li>
        <li>fail to pump as much blood as your body needs</li>
        Your doctor will detect these heart abnormalities during diagnosis.<br>


        <h3>Risk factors for CAD</h3><br>
        Understanding the risk factors for CAD can help with your plan to prevent or decrease the likelihood of developing the disease.<br>
        Risk factors include:<br>
        <li>high blood pressure</li>
        <li>high blood cholesterol levels</li>
        <li>tobacco smoking</li>
        <li>insulin resistance/hyperglycemia/diabetes mellitus</li>
        <li>obesity</li>
        <li>inactivity</li>
        <li>unhealthy eating habits</li>
        <li>obstructive sleep apnea</li>
        <li>emotional stress</li>
        <li>excessive alcohol consumption</li>
        <li>history of preeclampsia during pregnancy</li>
        The risk for CAD also increases with age. Based on age alone as a risk factor, men have a greater risk for the disease beginning at age 45 and women have a greater risk beginning at age 55. The risk for coronary artery disease is also higher if you have a family history of the disease.<br>


        <h3>Diagnosing CAD</h3>
        Diagnosing CAD requires a review of your medical history, a physical examination, and other medical testing. These tests include:<br>
        <li><b>Electrocardiogram: </b></li>This test monitors electrical signals that travel through your heart. It may help your doctor determine whether you’ve had a heart attack.<br>
        <li><b>Echocardiogram:</b></li> This imaging test uses ultrasound waves to create a picture of your heart. The results of this test reveal whether certain things in your heart are functioning properly.<br>
        <li><b>Stress test:</b></li> This particular test measures the stress on your heart during physical activity and while at rest. The test monitors your heart’s electrical activity while you walk on a treadmill or ride a stationary bike. Nuclear imaging may also be performed for a portion of this test. For those unable to perform physical exercise, certain medications can be used instead for stress testing.<br>
        <li><b>Cardiac catheterization (left heart catheterization):</b></li> During this procedure, your doctor injects a special dye into your coronary arteries through a catheter inserted through an artery in your groin or forearm. The dye helps enhance the radiographic image of your coronary arteries to identify any blockages.<br>
        <li><b>Heart CT scan:</b></li>Your doctor may use this imaging test to check for calcium deposits in your arteries.

        <h3>What is the treatment for CAD?</h3>
        It’s important to reduce or control your risk factors and seek treatment to lower the chance of a heart attack or stroke, if you’re diagnosed with CAD. Treatment also depends on your current health condition, risk factors, and overall wellbeing. For example, your doctor may prescribe medication therapy to treat high cholesterol or high blood pressure, or you may receive medication to control blood sugar if you have diabetes.<br>
        Lifestyle changes can also reduce your risk of heart disease and stroke. For example:<br>
        <li>quit smoking tobacco</li>
        <li>reduce or stop your consumption of alcohol</li>
        <li>exercise regularly</li>
        <li>lose weight to a healthy level</li>
        <li>eat a healthy diet (low in fat, low in sodium)</li>
        If your condition doesn’t improve with lifestyle changes and medication, your doctor may recommend a procedure to increase blood flow to your heart. These procedures may be:<br>
        <b>balloon angioplasty:</b> to widen blocked arteries and smoosh down the plaque buildup, usually performed with insertion of a stent to help keep the lumen open after the procedure<br>

        <b>coronary artery bypass graft surgery:</b> to restore blood flow to the heart in open chest surgery<br>
        <b>enhanced external counterpulsation:</b> to stimulate the formation of new small blood vessels to naturally bypass clogged arteries in a noninvasive procedure
        <br>
        <h3>What is the outlook for CAD?</h3>
        Everyone’s outlook for CAD is different. You have better chances of preventing extensive damage to your heart the earlier you can start your treatment or implement lifestyle changes.<br>
        It is important to follow your doctor’s instructions. Take medications as directed and make the recommended lifestyle changes. If you have a higher risk for CAD, you can help to prevent the disease by reducing your risk factors.<br>
        <br>
        <br>


        Abnormal heart rhythms, or arrhythmia
        <br> <br> <br>



        "Arrhythmia" means your heartbeat is irregular. It doesn't necessarily mean your heart is beating too fast or too slow. It just means it's out of its normal rhythm.<br>
        It may feel like your heart skipped a beat, added a beat, is "fluttering," or is beating too fast (which doctors call tachycardia) or too slow (called bradycardia). Or, you might not notice anything, since some arrhythmias are "silent."<br>
        Arrhythmias can be an emergency, or they may be harmless. If you feel something unusual happening with your heartbeat, call 911 so doctors can find out why it's happening and what you need to do about it.<br>
        <b>Causes and Types of of Arrhythmias</b>
        You could have an arrhythmia even if your heart is healthy. Or it could happen because you have:<br>
        <li>Heart disease</li>
        <li>The wrong balance of electrolytes (such as sodium or potassium) in your blood</li>
        <li>Changes in your heart muscle</li>
        <li>Injury from a heart attack</li>
        <li>Healing process after heart surgery</li>
        The many types of arrhythmias include:<br>
        <b>Premature atrial contractions.</b> These are early extra beats that start in the heart's upper chambers, called the atria. They are harmless and generally don't need treatment.
        <b> Premature ventricular contractions (PVCs).</b> These are among the most common arrhythmias.They're the "skipped heartbeat" we all occasionally feel. They can be related to stress or too much caffeine or nicotine. But sometimes, PVCs can be caused by heart disease or electrolyte imbalance. If you have a lot of PVCs, or symptoms linked to them, see a heart doctor (cardiologist).<br>
        <b>Atrial fibrillation.</b> This common irregular heart rhythm causes the upper chambers of the heart to contract abnormally.<br>

        <b>Atrial flutter.</b> This is an arrhythmia that's usually more organized and regular than atrial fibrillation. It happens most often in people with heart diseaseand in the first week after heart surgery. It often changes to atrial fibrillation.<br>
        <b>Paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia (PSVT).</b> A rapid heart rate, usually with a regular rhythm, starting from above the heart's lower chambers, or ventricles. PSVT begins and ends suddenly.<br>
        <b>Accessory pathway tachycardias.</b> You can get a rapid heart rate because there is an extra pathway between the heart's upper and lower chambers. It's just like if there was an extra road on your way home as well as your usual route, so cars can move around faster. When that happens in your heart, it can cause a fast heart rhythm, which doctors call tachycardia. The impulses that control your heart rhythm travel around the heart very quickly, making it beat unusually fast.<br>
        <b>AV nodal reentrant tachycardia. </b>This is another type of fast heartbeat. It's caused by there being an extra pathway through a part of the heart called the AV node. It can cause heart palpitations, fainting, or heart failure. In some cases, you can stop it simply by breathing in and bearing down. Some drugs can also stop this heart rhythm.<br>
        <b>Ventricular tachycardia (V-tach). </b>A rapid heart rhythm starting from the heart's lower chambers. Because the heart is beating too fast, it can't fill up with enough blood. This can be a serious arrhythmia -- especially in people with heart disease -- and it may be linked to other symptoms.<br>
        <b>Ventricular fibrillation.</b> This happens when the heart's lower chambers quiver and can't contract or pump blood to the body. This is a medical emergency that must be treated with CPR and defibrillation as soon as possible.<br>
        <b>Long QT syndrome. </b>This may cause potentially dangerous arrhythmias and sudden death. Doctors can treat it with medications or devices called defibrillators.<br>
        <b>Bradyarrhythmias.</b> These are slow heart rhythms, which may be due to disease in the heart's electrical system. When this occurs, you may feel like you are going to pass out, or actually pass out. This could also be from medication. The treatment for this could be a pacemaker. <br>
        If you experience this, call your doctor.<br>
        <b>Sinus node dysfunction.</b> This slow heart rhythm is due to a problem with the heart's sinus node. Some people with this type of arrhythmia need a pacemaker.<br>
        <b>Heart block. </b>There is a delay or a complete block of the electrical impulse as it travels from the heart's sinus node to its lower chambers. The heart may beat irregularly and, often, more slowly. In serious cases, you'd get a pacemaker.<br>
        <h3>Symptoms of Arrhythmias</h3>
        An arrhythmia can be silent, meaning you don't notice any symptoms. A doctor can find an irregular heartbeat during a physical exam by taking your pulse or through an electrocardiogram (ECG or EKG).<br>
        If you do have symptoms, they may include:<br>
        <li>Palpitations (a feeling of skipped heart beats, fluttering or "flip-flops")
        <li>Pounding in your chest</li>
        <li>Dizziness or feeling light-headed</li>
        <li>Fainting</li>
        <li>Shortness of breath</li>
        <li>Chest pain or tightness</li>
        <li>Weakness or fatigue (feeling very tired)</li>
        <li>Diagnosis of Arrhythmias</li>
        <li>To diagnose an arrhythmia or find its cause, doctors use tests including:<br>
            <b>
        <li>Electrocardiogram --</li></b> Also called an EKG or ECG, this test records the electrical activity of your heart. You wear small electrode patches on your chest, arms, and legs for the quick, painless test, which you take in your doctor's office.<br>
        <b>
            <li>Holter monitor --</li>
        </b> This is a portable EKG that you'll use for 1 to 2 days. You'll have electrodes taped to your skin. It's painless and you can do everything but shower while wearing the electrodes.<br>
        <b>
            <li>Event monitor -- </li>
        </b>If your symptoms don't happen often, your doctor may suggest you wear one of these, usually for about a month. This is a device that, when you push a button, will record and store your heart's electrical activity for a few minutes. Each time you notice symptoms, you should try to get a reading on the monitor. Your doctor will interpret the results.<br>
        <b>
            <li>Stress test --</li>
        </b> There are different kinds of stress tests. The goal is to check how much stress your heart can manage before having a heart rhythm problem or not getting enough blood flow to the heart. For the most common type of stress test, you'll walk on a treadmill or pedal a stationary bike at increasing levels of difficulty while you're getting an EKG and getting your heart rate and blood pressure monitored.<br>
        <b>
            <li>Echocardiogram --</li>
        </b> This test uses ultrasound to evaluate heart muscle and heart valves.
        <b>
            <li>Cardiac catheterization --</li>
        </b> Your doctor will insert a long, thin tube, called a catheter, into a blood vessel in your arm or leg. She will guide it to your heart with help from a special X-ray machine. Then she'll inject dye through the catheter to help make X-ray videos of your heart's valves, coronary arteries, and chambers.<br>
        <b>
            <li>Electrophysiology study --</li>
        </b> This test records your heart's electrical activities and pathways. It can help find out what's causing heart rhythm problems and find the best treatment for you. During the test, your doctor will safely reproduce your abnormal heart rhythm and then may give you different medications to see which controls it best, or to see what procedure or device you need to treat it.<br>
        <b>
            <li>Head-up tilt table test --</li>
        </b> Doctors use this test to find out what's causing fainting spells. It measures the difference in heart rate and blood pressure when you're standing up or lying down. You'll get this test in a lab. You'll lie on a stretcher, tilted at different angles while you're getting an EKG and specialists are checking your blood pressure and oxygen level. This shows if symptoms of passing out are due to the electrical system, the nervous system, or the vascular system.<br>
        <h3> Treatment of Arrhythmias</h3>
       <b> What Is Electrical Cardioversion?</b>
       <p>If drugs can't control a persistent irregular heart rhythm (such as atrial fibrillation), you might need cardioversion. For this, doctors, give you a short-acting anesthesia, then deliver an electrical shock to your chest wall to allow the normal rhythm to restart.</p> 
        What Is a Pacemaker?
       <p>This device sends small electrical impulses to the heart muscle to keep a safe heart rate. The pacemaker has a pulse generator (which houses the battery and a tiny computer) and wires that send impulses from the pulse generator to the heart muscle.</p> 
        What Is an Implantable Cardioverter Defibrillator (ICD)?
        Doctors mainly use ICDs to treat ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation, two life-threatening heart rhythms.
       <p> The ICD constantly tracks the heart rhythm. When it detects a very fast, abnormal heart rhythm, it delivers an electric shock to the heart muscle to cause the heart to beat in a normal rhythm again. There are several ways the ICD can be used to restore normal heart rhythm. They include:</p>
       <b> Anti-tachycardia pacing (ATP).</b><p>When the heart beats too fast, you get a series of small electrical impulses to the heart muscle to restore a normal heart rate and rhythm.</p> 
       <b>Cardioversion.</b> <p> You may get a low-energy shock at the same time as the heart beats to restore normal heart rhythm.</p>
       <b> Defibrillation</b> <p>When the heart is beating dangerously fast or irregularly, the heart muscle gets a higher-energy shock to restore a normal rhythm.</p>
       <b>Anti-bradycardia pacing.</b>  Many ICDs provide back-up pacing to maintain heart rhythm if it slows too much.
       <b> What Is Catheter Ablation?</b>
        <p>You can think of this procedure as rewiring to fix an electrical problem within the heart.
        The doctor will insert a catheter through the leg. The catheter delivers high-frequency electrical energy to a small area inside the heart that causes the abnormal heart rhythm. This energy "disconnects" the pathway of the abnormal rhythm.
            Doctors use ablation to treat most PSVTs, atrial flutter, atrial fibrillation, and some atrial and ventricular tachycardias. Some people also need other procedures.</p>
      <b> Heart Surgery for Arrhythmias</b> 
       <p> The Maze procedure is a type of surgery used to correct atrial fibrillation. During this procedure, the surgeon makes a series, or "maze," of cuts in the heart's upper chambers. The goal is to keep the heart's electrical impulses only on certain pathways. Some people may need a pacemaker afterward.</p>

        If you have heart failure, you have a lot of choices for treatment. Your doctor may suggest you start with medication and lifestyle changes. If your condition gets worse, you can turn to centers that specialize in treating heart failure for more options, like surgery.
        Medicines
        It's important to keep up with your medications and take them the way your doctor tells you to. Common types of drugs that treat heart failure are:
        Aldosterone antagonist
        ACE inhibitors
        ARBs (angiotensin II receptor blockers)
        ARNIs (angiotensin receptor-neprilysin inhibitors)
        Beta-blockers
        Blood vessel dilators
        Calcium channel blockers (unless you have systolic heart failure)
        Digoxin
        Diuretics
        Heart pump medication
        Potassium or magnesium
        Selective sinus node inhibitors
        Surgery and Medical Device Options
        The goal of surgery is to make your heart work better.
        Bypass surgery. Routes blood around a blocked artery.

       Cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT). When your heartbeat is off-kilter, it can make heart failure worse. This treatment uses a pacemaker that sends timed electrical impulses to both of your heart's lower chambers (the left and right ventricles) so they pump better and more in sync. Your doctor may call it a biventricular pacemaker. He could also pair it with an ICD (see below).
        Heart transplant. This is done when heart failure is so severe that it doesn't respond to any other treatments.
        Heart valve surgery. If a faulty heart valve causes your heart failure, your doctor may recommend repairing or replacing it. A surgeon can repair or replace the valves.
   

        Implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD). This device is similar to a pacemaker. It's put under your skin in your chest. Wires lead through your veins and into your heart to keep track of your heart rhythm. If your heart starts to beat at a dangerous rhythm, or if it stops, the ICD tries to pace your heart or shock it back into normal rhythm. An ICD can also act as a pacemaker and speed your heart up if it's going too slow.
        Infarct exclusion surgery (modified Dor or Dor procedure). When a heart attack happens in the left ventricle (the lower left chamber of your heart), a scar forms. The scarred area is thin and can bulge out with each beat, forming what's called an aneurysm. A heart surgeon can remove it.
        Ventricular assist device. The doctor puts it into the abdomen or chest and attaches it to your heart to help it pump blood to the rest of your body. VADs are most often used in the heart's left ventricle, but they can also be used in the right ventricle or in both ventricles.
        How Can I Keep My Heart Failure From Getting Worse?
        Monitor your symptoms. Check for changes in how much fluid builds up in your body by weighing yourself every day. Check for swelling, too.
        See your doctor regularly. He'll make sure you're staying healthy and that your heart failure isn't getting worse. He'll ask to review your weight record and list of medications.
        If you have questions, write them down and bring them with you to your appointment. Call your doctor if you have urgent concerns.
        Tell all the doctors you see about your heart failure, the medications you take, and any restrictions you have. Also, tell your heart doctor about any new drugs prescribed by another doctor.
        How Can I Prevent Further Damage?
        If you smoke or chew tobacco, quit.
        Keep to a healthy weight.
        Control your blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and diabetes.
        Exercise regularly.
        Don't drink alcohol.
        Your Heart Failure To-Do List
        Eat a healthy diet. Limit the salt you eat to less than 1,500 milligrams each day. Eat foods high in fiber and potassium. Cut back on things high in saturated fat, cholesterol, and sugar. If you need to drop some weight, reduce the number of calories you eat.
        Exercise regularly. A regular program that's OK'd by your doctor will improve your symptoms and strength and make you feel better. It may also slow your heart failure.
        Don't overdo it. Plan out your activities and include rest periods during the day.
        Prevent lung infections. Ask your doctor about flu and pneumonia vaccines.
        Take your medications as prescribed. Don't stop taking them without first asking your doctor. Even if you have no symptoms, the drugs help your heart pump better.
        Get emotional or psychological support, if you need it. Don't face things alone. Get the backing you need from social workers, psychologists, clergy, and support groups. Ask your doctor to point you in the right direction.
        Be the Star of Your Team
        It takes a team to manage heart failure, and you are the key player. Your heart doctor will prescribe your medications and manage other medical problems. Other team members, including nurses, dietitians, pharmacists, exercise specialists, and social workers, will also lend a hand. But it's up to you to take your medicine, change your diet, live a healthy lifestyle, keep your follow-up appointments, and be an active member of the team.
